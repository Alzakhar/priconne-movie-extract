Simple movie downloader. 

Because it is simple, it SUCKS. A lot.

 Also only EN is working right now because I can't be bothered to get the JP manifest and add it.

If you do decide to use this, beware that it will lag your computer. 

If you want to change the movie manifest, feel free to get it from the server and then rename it as movie2manifest_(server)
The version here is 10008500 (en) which was the latest one I could find. The one before that was 10008400 and then 10008300 and so on and so forth
