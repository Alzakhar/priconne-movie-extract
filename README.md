Simple movie downloader. 

This is built on work by [Andu2](https://github.com/Andu2/priconne-cdn-extract), built on work by [S'pugn](https://github.com/Expugn/priconne-en_db-fetch), which was built on work by [esterTion](https://redive.estertion.win/).

This is just a tool to download the USM files from the Priconne CDNs.

Because it is simple, it SUCKS. A lot. If you do decide to use this, beware that it will lag your computer. Please don't use the all option. 

If you want to change the movie manifest, feel free to get it from the server and then rename it as movie2manifest_(server)
The version here for EN is 10008500 (September 2022) which was the latest one I could find. The one before that was 10008400 and then 10008300 and so on and so forth

https://assets-priconne-redive-us.akamaized.net/dl/Resources/10008500/Jpn/Movie/SP/High/manifest/movie2manifest if you want it yourself. The link will probably die on the 30th of April 2023 because of Priconne EN's EOS

JP manifest is from 31 March 2023. 10046500 is very new. I can promise that at least.
