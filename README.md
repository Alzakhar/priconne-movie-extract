Simple movie downloader. 

This is built on work by [Andu2](https://github.com/Andu2/priconne-cdn-extract), built on work by [S'pugn](https://github.com/Expugn/priconne-en_db-fetch), which was built on work by [esterTion](https://redive.estertion.win/).

This is just a tool to download the USM files from the Priconne CDNs.

Because it is simple, it SUCKS. A lot. If you do decide to use this, beware that it will lag your computer. Please don't use the all option. 

If you want to change the movie manifest, feel free to get it from the server and then rename it as movie2manifest_(server) or moviemanifest_(server)
The version here for EN is 10011200 - last modified on Mon, 10 Apr 2023 05:26:00 GMT - which was the latest one I could find. 
JP I think is 10046500, also pretty new.

~~https://assets-priconne-redive-us.akamaized.net/dl/Resources/10008500/Jpn/Movie/SP/High/manifest/movie2manifest if you want it yourself. The link will probably die on the 30th of April 2023 because of Priconne EN's EOS
After 10008500, replaced movie2manifest with moviemanifest because Crunchyroll decided to be a asshole.~~ It's dead. RIP

Requires NODE.js
